# EndCapture
Ends a capture interval that was started with `BeginCapture`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```C++  
void EndCapture();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 A capture interval typically spans a subset of one frame, such as when you want to capture graphics information only about a certain kind of draw call. If the capture interval spans a call to present, then two frames of graphics information are captured. The first frame spans the interval between the call to `BeginCapture` and the call to present; the second frame spans the interval between the first Direct3D event after the call to present and the call to `EndCapture`.  
  
 To capture an interval, you must prepare your app to capture and record graphics informationâ€”that is, you must have called [Init](init.md) through an instance of the `VsgDbg` class before you call `BeginCapture` or `EndCapture`.
