# Edit and Continue Dialog Box (C++)
Edit and Continue could not apply the changes you made to your native code. This may be a temporary condition. Sometimes Edit and Continue cannot apply native code changes immediately, but can apply them later during the debugging session (for example, after completion of the current call to the procedure now executing). For more information, see [Edit and Continue](../debugger/edit-and-continue.md).  
  
 You can edit the code to fix the error while still debugging, stop debugging and fix the code, or ignore the error and continue debugging. If you continue without making the fix, your code changes will not be applied immediately.
