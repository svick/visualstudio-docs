# How to: Step out of Managed Code when Native Frames are Missing from the Call Stack Window

If your code has native frames that are invisible in the **Call Stack** window, stepping out of managed code can produce unexpected results. As a workaround, you can use a breakpoint instead of **Step Out**.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Reset settings](../ide/environment-settings.md#reset-settings).

## Step out of managed code when native frames are missing from the call stack display

1.  In the native code, set a location breakpoint after the call to managed code.

2.  On the **Debug** menu, choose **Continue**.

     When the managed call is completed, execution will stop at the breakpoint in native code.
