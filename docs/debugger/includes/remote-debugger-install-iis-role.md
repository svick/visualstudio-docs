These steps show only a basic configuration of IIS. For more in-depth information or to install to a Windows Desktop machine, see [Publishing to IIS](/aspnet/core/publishing/iis?tabs=aspnetcore2x#iis-configuration) or [IIS 8.0 Using ASP.NET 3.5 and ASP.NET 4.5](/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-8/iis-80-using-aspnet-35-and-aspnet-45).

For Windows Server operating systems, use the **Add Roles and Features** wizard via the **Manage** link or the **Dashboard** link in **Server Manager**. On the **Server Roles** step, check the box for **Web Server (IIS)**.

![The Web Server IIS role is selected in the Select server roles step.](../media/remotedbg-server-roles-ws2012.png)

On the **Role services** step, select the IIS role services you desire or accept the default role services provided. If you want to enable deployment using publish settings and Web Deploy, make sure that **IIS Management Scripts and Tools** is selected.

Proceed through the confirmation steps to install the web server role and services. A server/IIS restart is not required after installing the Web Server (IIS) role.
