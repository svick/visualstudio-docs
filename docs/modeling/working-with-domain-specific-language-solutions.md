 Discusses how to develop DSLs and how to apply them.

 [Overview of Domain-Specific Language Tools](../modeling/overview-of-domain-specific-language-tools.md)
 Explains the major tasks in developing and distributing a DSL.

 [Overview of the Domain-Specific Language Tools User Interface](../modeling/overview-of-the-domain-specific-language-tools-user-interface.md)
 Describes the windows that are associated with DSLs.

 [Choosing a Domain-Specific Language Solution Template](../modeling/choosing-a-domain-specific-language-solution-template.md)
 Explains how to choose a template to start your DSL project.

 [How to: Create a Domain-Specific Language Solution](../modeling/how-to-create-a-domain-specific-language-solution.md)

 [How to: Change the Namespace of a Domain-Specific Language](../modeling/how-to-change-the-namespace-of-a-domain-specific-language.md)
 The code you generate from a DSL has a namespace that you set when you initiate your solution, but you can change it afterwards.

 [How to: Extend the Domain-Specific Language Designer](../modeling/how-to-extend-the-domain-specific-language-designer.md)
 You can customize the DSL Designer with menu commands.
