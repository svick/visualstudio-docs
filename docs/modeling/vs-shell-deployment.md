# VS Shell deployment

An isolated shell lets you determine which Visual Studio functionality you need to interact with your domain-specific language and how that solution should appear. For more information about the Visual Studio isolated shell, see [Customizing the Isolated Shell](https://vspartner.com/pages/vsshells).

To set a Visual Studio Shell as the deployment target:

1. In the **DslPackage** project, open **source.extension.tt**.

2. Under `<SupportedProducts>` insert:

   ```xml
   <IsolatedShell Version="1.0">MyIsolatedShell</IsolatedShell>
   ```

   Replace *MyIsolatedShell* with the name of your isolated shell package.
