# Visual Studio product feedback

Talk to us! We're interested in your ideas for improving our products and documentation. We can't always respond personally, but we'll make sure that your feedback gets to the right person or team.

## I want to report a problem with Visual Studio

If you experience problems with Visual Studio&mdash;such as crashes, sluggish performance, or unexpected behavior&mdash;let us know by using the **Report a Problem** tool. In Visual Studio, choose the feedback icon next to **Quick Launch**, or choose **Help** > **Send Feedback** > **Report a Problem** from the menu bar. Next, Visual Studio opens the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com) page in your browser, where you can sign in to report the problem. For more information, see [How to report a problem with Visual Studio 2017](how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017.md).

## I want to make a suggestion about Visual Studio features

If there's something we can do better, tell us about it! In Visual Studio, choose **Help** > **Send Feedback** > **Provide a Suggestion** from the menu bar. Next, Visual Studio opens the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com) page in your browser, where you can sign in to share your idea. For more information, see [Suggest a feature for Visual Studio 2017](suggest-a-feature.md).

### Rate this product

Pre-release versions of Visual Studio have a **Rate this Product** menu item that released versions of the product don't have. Use the **Rate this Product** menu item to send feedback on the quality of the pre-release build that you're running.

## I want to contact Microsoft Support

For Visual Studio support information, see the [Support life cycle & servicing](/visualstudio/productinfo/vs-servicing-vs) page.

For other Microsoft products and services, see [Microsoft support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99019) for online help.

> [!NOTE]
> Support outside the United States and Canada may vary. For a list of regional contacts, see [Microsoft worldwide sites](http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/).

For larger organizations that require managed support directly from Microsoft, contracts are available through various Enterprise Support offerings. For more information, see [Microsoft Enterprise Support solutions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=258223).

If the product came installed with a new computer or device, the hardware manufacturer provides technical support and assistance for this software. Contact the manufacturer directly for support.

Microsoft support services are subject to then-current prices, terms, and conditions. Prices, terms, and conditions can change without notice.

## I want to get involved in the developer community

If you want to share your questions and answers with other developers, use the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com) site, the [MSDN forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/home), or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can also view code from other developers and share your own examples on the [Developer code samples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/) site.

## I want to help improve the Visual Studio documentation

Please use the **Was this page helpful?** feedback button at the bottom of the page. You can find this button on all our documentation pages. Alternatively, you can add feedback to any Visual Studio page on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/) by using the **Sign in to give documentation feedback** button, also at the bottom of the page.
