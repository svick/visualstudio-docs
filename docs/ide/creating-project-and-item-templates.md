# Project and item templates

Project and item templates provide reusable stubs that give users some basic code and structure, that they can customize for their own purposes.

## Visual Studio templates

A number of predefined project and item templates are installed with Visual Studio. For example, the Visual Basic and C# **Windows Forms App** and **Class Library** templates that are shown in the **New Project** dialog box are project templates. Item templates show in the **Add New Item** dialog box, and include items such as code files, XML files, HTML pages, and Style Sheets.

These templates provide a starting point for users to begin creating projects, or to expand existing projects. Project templates provide the files that are required for a particular project type, include standard assembly references, and set default project properties and compiler options. Item templates can range in complexity from a single empty file that has a certain file extension, to multiple source code files with stub code, designer information files, and embedded resources.

You can use installed templates in the **New Project** and **Add New Item** dialog boxes, author your own templates, or download and use templates created by the community. For more information, see [How to: Create project templates](../ide/how-to-create-project-templates.md) and [How to: Create item templates](../ide/how-to-create-item-templates.md).

## Contents of a template

All project and item templates, whether installed with Visual Studio or created by you, function using the same principles and have similar contents. All templates contain the following items:

- The files to be created when the template is used. These files include source code files, embedded resources, project files, and so on.

- One *.vstemplate* file, containing the metadata needed to display the template in the **New Project** and **Add New Item** dialog boxes and create a project or item from the template. For more information about *.vstemplate* files, see [Template parameters](../ide/template-parameters.md).

When these files are compressed into a *.zip* file and put in the correct folder, Visual Studio automatically displays them in the following places:

- Project templates appear in the **New Project** dialog box.

- Item templates appear in the **Add New Item** dialog box.

For more information about template folders, see [How to: Locate and organize templates](../ide/how-to-locate-and-organize-project-and-item-templates.md).
