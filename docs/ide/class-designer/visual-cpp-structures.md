# Visual C++ structures in Class Designer

**Class Designer** supports C++ structures, which are declared with the keyword `struct`. Following is an example:

```cpp
struct MyStructure
{
   char a;
   int i;
   long j;
};
```

For more information about using the `struct` type, see [struct](/cpp/cpp/struct-cpp).

A C++ structure shape in a class diagram looks and works like a class shape, except that the label reads **Struct** and it has square corners instead of rounded corners.

|Code element|Class Designer view|
|------------------| - |
|`struct StructureName {};`|**StructureName**<br /><br /> Struct|
