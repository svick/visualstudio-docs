# Globalizing and localizing applications

If you plan on distributing your application to an international audience, you'll need to keep several things in mind during the design and development phases. Even if you don't have such plans, a small effort up front can make things considerably easier should your plans change in future versions of your application. Services built into the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] make it easy to develop a single application that can adapt to different locales using managed development with Visual Studio.

## Resources

 Visual Studio was designed from the start to make developing for an international audience easy by taking advantage of services built into the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)]. The following articles will help introduce you to the internationalization features built into Visual Studio.

 [Introduction to international applications based on the .NET Framework](../ide/introduction-to-international-applications-based-on-the-dotnet-framework.md)
 Introduces the concepts related to developing software for an international market using Visual Studio and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)].

 [Localizing applications](../ide/localizing-applications.md)
 Provides links to pages about customizing applications for a given culture.

 [Globalizing applications](../ide/globalizing-applications.md)
 Provides links to pages about creating applications that support multiple cultures.

- [Class library overview](/dotnet/standard/class-library-overview) introduces the classes, interfaces, and value types that expedite and optimize the development process and provide access to system functionality.
- <xref:System.Globalization> points out the classes in this namespace, which define culture-related information, including the language, the country/region, the calendars in use, the format patterns for dates, currency and numbers, and the sort order for strings.
- <xref:System.Resources> points out the classes and interfaces in this namespace, which allows developers to create, store, and manage various culture-specific resources used in an application.
