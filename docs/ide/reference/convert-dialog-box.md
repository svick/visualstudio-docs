# Convert Dialog Box

The **Convert** dialog box allows you to select a conversion tool to create a new project from an old one, such as creating a [!INCLUDE[vbprvblong](../../ide/reference/includes/vbprvblong_md.md)] project from a Visual Basic 6 project. You can also use the [Visual Studio Project Converter](https://github.com/ssvaidya/VSProjectConverter) to upgrade projects created in previous versions of Visual Studio.

## Open the Convert Dialog Box

1.  On the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open**, **Convert**.

     You will see a list of the code-conversion tools that are currently available.

2.  Select the tool that is appropriate for your application.
