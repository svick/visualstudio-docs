# Find in Files

**Find in Files** allows you to search a specified set of files. The matches found and actions taken are listed in the **Find Results** window selected in **Result options**.

You can use any of the following methods to display **Find in Files** in the **Find and Replace** window.

## To display Find in Files

1. On the menu bar, choose **Edit** > **Find and Replace**.

1. Choose **Find in Files**.

To cancel a Find operation, press **Ctrl** + **Break**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Find and Replace tool does not search directories with the `Hidden` or `System` attribute.

## Find what

To search for a new text string or expression, specify it in the box. To search for any of the 20 strings that you searched for most recently, open the drop-down list and choose the string. Choose the adjacent **Expression Builder** button if you want to use one or more regular expressions in your search string. For more information, see [Using regular expressions in Visual Studio](../ide/using-regular-expressions-in-visual-studio.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Expression Builder** button will only be enabled if you have selected **Use Regular Expressions** under **Find options**.

## Look in

The option chosen from the **Look in** drop-down list determines whether **Find in Files** searches only in currently active files or in all files stored within certain folders. Select a search scope from the list or click the **Browse (...)** button to display the **Choose Search Folders** dialog box and to enter your own set of directories. You can also type a path directly into the **Look in** box.

> [!WARNING]
> With the **Entire Solution** or **Current Project** options, project and solution files are not searched. If you want to look in project files, choose a search folder.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Look in** option selected causes you to search a file that you have checked out from source code control, only the version of that file which has been downloaded to your local machine is searched.

## Include subfolders

Specifies that subfolders of the **Look in** folder will be searched.

## Find options

You can expand or collapse the **Find options** section. The following options can be selected or cleared:

**Match case**

When selected, a **Find Results** search will be case-sensitive

**Match whole word**

When selected, the **Find Results** windows will only return whole word matches.

**Use Regular Expressions**

If this check box is selected, you can use special notations to define patterns of text to match in the **Find what** or **Replace with** text boxes. For a list of these notations, see [Using regular expressions in Visual Studio](../ide/using-regular-expressions-in-visual-studio.md).

**Look at these file types**

This list indicates the types of files to search through in the **Look in** directories. If this field is blank, all of the files in the **Look in** directories will be searched.

Select any item in the list to enter a preconfigured search string that will find files of those particular types.

## Result options

You can expand or collapse the **Result options** section. The following options can be selected or cleared:

**Find results 1 window**

When selected, the results of the current search will replace the content of the **Find Results 1** window. This window opens automatically to display your search results. To open this window manually, select **Other Windows** from the **View** menu and choose **Find Results 1**.

**Find results 2 window**

When selected, the results of the current search will replace the content of the **Find Results 2** window. This window opens automatically to display your search results. To open this window manually, select **Other Windows** from the **View** menu and choose **Find Results 2**.

**Display file names only**

Displays a list of files containing search matches rather than displaying the search matches themselves.

**Append results**

Appends the results from the search to the previous search results.
