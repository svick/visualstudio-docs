# How to: Change the build output directory

You can specify the location of output on a per-configuration basis (for debug, release, or both) generated by your project.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a **Setup** project, see the note at the end of this article.

## Change the build output directory

1.  On the menu bar, choose **Project** > **\<Appname> Properties**. You can also right-click the project node in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**.

2.  If you have a Visual Basic project, select the **Compile** tab. If you have a C# project, select the **Build** tab. If you have a C++ project or a JavaScript project, select the **General** tab.

3.  In the configuration drop-down at the top, choose the configuration whose output file location you want to change (debug, release, or all).

     Find the output path entry (**Build output path** in Visual Basic, **Output directory** in Visual C++, **Output path** in JavaScript and C#). Specify a new build output directory relative to the project directory.

> [!NOTE]
> In a Setup Project, the **Output file name** box changes only the location of the *Setup.exe* file, not the location of the project files. For more information, see **Build, Configuration Properties, Deployment Project Properties dialog box**.
