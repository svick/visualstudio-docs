# Troubleshooting Code Metrics Issues
You might encounter some of the following issues when you collect code metrics:

-   [Changes in Visual Studio 2010 code complexity calculations](#Changes_in_Visual_Studio_2010_code_complexity_calculations)

##  <a name="Changes_in_Visual_Studio_2010_code_complexity_calculations"></a> Changes in Visual Studio 2010 code complexity calculations
 For the same function, the code complexity metric calculated in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../code-quality/includes/vs_dev10_long_md.md)] can be different from the metric calculated by earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../code-quality/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] for the following situations:

- The function contains one or more catch blocks. In previous versions of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../code-quality/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)], catch blocks were not included in the calculation. In [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../code-quality/includes/vs_dev10_long_md.md)], the complexity of each catch block is added to the complexity of the function.

- The function contains a switch (Select Case in VB) statement. Compiler differences between [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../code-quality/includes/vs_dev10_long_md.md)] and earlier versions can generate different MSIL code for some switch statements that contain fall-through cases.
