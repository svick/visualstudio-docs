## Cause

The constructor of an unsealed type calls a virtual method defined in its class.

## Rule description

When a virtual method is called, the actual type that executes the method is not selected until run time. When a constructor calls a virtual method, it is possible that the constructor for the instance that invokes the method has not executed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, do not call a type's virtual methods from within the type's constructors.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The constructor should be redesigned to eliminate the call to the virtual method.

## Example

The following example demonstrates the effect of violating this rule. The test application creates an instance of `DerivedType`, which causes its base class (`BadlyConstructedType`) constructor to execute. `BadlyConstructedType`'s constructor incorrectly calls the virtual method `DoSomething`. As the output shows, `DerivedType.DoSomething()` executes, and does so before `DerivedType`'s constructor executes.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca2214-do-not-call-overridable-methods-in-constructors_1.cs)]
[!code-vb[FxCop.Usage.CtorVirtual#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca2214-do-not-call-overridable-methods-in-constructors_1.vb)]

This example produces the following output:

```txt
Calling base ctor.
Derived DoSomething is called - initialized ? No
Calling derived ctor.
```
