# C26409 NO_NEW_DELETE
  Even if code is clean of calls to malloc() and free() we still suggest that you consider better options than explicit use of operators [new and delete](/cpp/cpp/new-and-delete-operators). See more details in the description of the rule *R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly*. The ultimate fix is to start using smart pointers with appropriate factory functions, such as [std::make_unique](/cpp/standard-library/memory-functions#make_unique).

## Remarks
- The checker warns on calls to any kind of operator `new` or `delete`: scalar, vector, overloaded versions (global and class-specific), as well as on placement versions. The latter case may require some clarifications on the Core Guidelines in terms of suggested fixes and may be omitted in the future.
