# CA1012: Abstract types should not have constructors

## Cause
 A public type is abstract and has a public constructor.

## Rule description
 Constructors on abstract types can be called only by derived types. Because public constructors create instances of a type, and you cannot create instances of an abstract type, an abstract type that has a public constructor is incorrectly designed.

## How to fix violations
 To fix a violation of this rule, either make the constructor protected or do not declare the type as abstract.

## When to suppress warnings
 Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The abstract type has a public constructor.

## Example
 The following example contains an abstract type that violates this rule.

 [!code-vb[FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1012-abstract-types-should-not-have-constructors_1.vb)]
 [!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.AbstractTypeBad#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1012-abstract-types-should-not-have-constructors_1.cs)]

## Example
 The following example fixes the previous violation by changing the accessibility of the constructor from `public` to `protected`.
