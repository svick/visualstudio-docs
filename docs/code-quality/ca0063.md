# CA0063

Failed to load rule set file or one of its dependent rule set files.

Failed to load rule set file or one of its dependent rule set files.

The specified rule set could not be found or one of the rule set files included in your rule set could not be found. Make sure that the all the rule sets included in your rule set exist on disk and that the appropriate rule set directories are being specified in your project through the **CodeAnalysisRuleSetDirectories** property of [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)].

To debug the error, examine your rule set file in a text editor. To find the path to the rule set file, right-click the project in Solution Explorer, click **Properties**, and then click **Code Analysis**. Make sure the rule set file is selected in **Run this rule set**. The Path to the rule set is listed in the description field.

Examine the **Path** attribute value all the **Include** elements. Include paths can use relative paths to the parent/current rule set file, environment variables, and absolute paths. For example:

```xml
<Include Path="%PUBLIC%\Documents\RuleSets\alldesign.ruleset" Action="Default" />
<Include Path="..\alldesign.ruleset" Action="Default" />
<Include Path="C:\Rulesets\alldesign.ruleset" Action="Default" />
```

Inspect each of these include paths and verify they are all valid.

In some cases, the location of a rule set can be dependent on an [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] property. [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] properties cannot be referenced from a rule set. To work around this issue, specify additional search paths in the **CodeAnalysisRuleSetDirectories** property of [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../extensibility/internals/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)]. In this scenario, specify only the name of the rule set in the **Path** attribute of the **Include** element.
