# MergeLocalizationDirectives task
The <xref:Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows.MergeLocalizationDirectives> task merges the localization attributes and comments of one or more [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../msbuild/includes/tla2sharptla_xaml_md.md)] binary format files into a single file for the whole assembly.  
  
## Task parameters  
  
| Parameter | Description |
|------------------------------| - |
| `GeneratedLocalizationFiles` | Required **ITaskItem[]** parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the list of localization directives files for individual files in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../msbuild/includes/tla2sharptla_xaml_md.md)] binary format. |
| `OutputFile` | Required **String** output parameter.<br /><br /> Specifies the output path of the compiled localization-directives assembly. |
  
## Remarks  
 You can add localization attributes and comments to [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../msbuild/includes/tlasharptla_xaml_md.md)] content. With [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../msbuild/includes/tlasharptla_wpf_md.md)] localization support, you can strip out localization attributes and comments, and put them in a *.loc* file that is separate from the generated assembly. You can do this by using the **LocalizationPropertyStorage** attribute. For more information about localization attributes and comments, and **LocalizationPropertyStorage**, see [Localization attributes and comments](/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/localization-attributes-and-comments).  
  
## Example  
 The following example merges the localization comments of several [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../msbuild/includes/tla2sharptla_xaml_md.md)] binary format files into a single *.loc* file.  
  
```xml  
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <UsingTask   
    TaskName="Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows.MergeLocalizationDirectives"   
    AssemblyFile="C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0\PresentationBuildTasks.dll" />  
  <Target Name="MergeLocalizationDirectivesTask">  
    <MergeLocalizationDirectives   
      GeneratedLocalizationFiles="obj\debug\page1.loc;obj\debug\page2.loc;obj\debug\page3.loc"  
      OutputFile="obj\debug\WPFMSBuildSample.loc" />  
  </Target>  
</Project>  
```
