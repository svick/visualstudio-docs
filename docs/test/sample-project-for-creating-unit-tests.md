# Sample code for testing

This sample code contains a class, *BankAccount*, with various methods that can be tested through unit tests.

The code is used in the following walkthroughs:

- [Create and run unit tests for managed code](../test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code.md). This walkthrough leads you through the steps to create and customize unit tests, run them, and examine the test results.
- [Use the command-line test utility](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/52c11992-9e94-4067-a4b7-59f19d69d867). In this walkthrough, you use the *MSTest.exe* command-line utility to run tests and view results.

## Sample code

The only intentional error in this sample is that the in Debit method "m_balance += amount" should have a minus not a plus sign before the equals sign.

```csharp
using System;

namespace BankAccountNS
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Bank Account demo class.
    /// </summary>
    public class BankAccount
    {
        private string m_customerName;

        private double m_balance;

        private bool m_frozen = false;

        private BankAccount()
        {
        }

        public BankAccount(string customerName, double balance)
        {
            m_customerName = customerName;
            m_balance = balance;
        }

        public string CustomerName
        {
            get { return m_customerName; }
        }

        public double Balance
        {
            get { return m_balance; }
        }

        public void Debit(double amount)
        {
            if (m_frozen)
            {
                throw new Exception("Account frozen");
            }

            if (amount > m_balance)
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("amount");
            }

            if (amount < 0)
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("amount");
            }

            m_balance += amount; // intentionally incorrect code
        }

        public void Credit(double amount)
        {
            if (m_frozen)
            {
                throw new Exception("Account frozen");
            }

            if (amount < 0)
            {
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("amount");
            }

            m_balance += amount;
        }

        private void FreezeAccount()
        {
            m_frozen = true;
        }

        private void UnfreezeAccount()
        {
            m_frozen = false;
        }

        public static void Main()
        {
            BankAccount ba = new BankAccount("Mr. Bryan Walton", 11.99);

            ba.Credit(5.77);
            ba.Debit(11.22);
            Console.WriteLine("Current balance is ${0}", ba.Balance);
        }
    }
}
```

## Create the project

To work with this code, first create a project for it in Visual Studio. Follow the steps to create the project in [Walkthrough: Create and run unit tests for managed code](../test/walkthrough-creating-and-running-unit-tests-for-managed-code.md#create-a-project-to-test).
