# Analyzing coded UI tests using coded UI test logs

Coded UI test logs filter and record important information about your coded UI test runs. The logs are presented in a format that allows for debugging issues quickly.

[!INCLUDE [coded-ui-test-deprecation](includes/coded-ui-test-deprecation.md)]

## Step 1: Enable logging

Depending on your scenario, use one of the following methods to enable the log:

- Target .NET Framework version 4 with no *App.config* file present in the test project:

   1. Open the *QTAgent32_40.exe.config* file. By default, this file is located in *%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE*.

   2. Modify the value for EqtTraceLevel to the log level you want.

   3. Save the file.

- Target .NET Framework version 4.5 with no *App.config* file present in the test project:

   1. Open the *QTAgent32.exe.config* file. By default, this file is located in *%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE*.

   2. Modify the value of the EqtTraceLevel to the log level you want.

   3. Save the file.

- *App.config* file is present in the test project:

    - Open the *App.config* file in the project, and add the following code under the configuration node:

      ```xml
      <system.diagnostics>
        <switches>
          <add name="EqtTraceLevel" value="4" />
        </switches>
      </system.diagnostics>`
      ```

- Enable logging from the test code itself:

   <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITesting.PlaybackSettings.LoggerOverrideState%2A> = HtmlLoggerState.AllActionSnapshot;

## Step 2: Run your coded UI test and view the log

When you run a coded UI test with the modifications to the *QTAgent32.exe.config* file in place, you see an output link in the **Test Explorer** results. Log files are produced not only when your test fails, but also for successful tests when the trace level is set to "verbose."

1.  On the **Test** menu, choose **Windows** and then select **Test Explorer**.

2.  On the **Build** menu, choose **Build Solution**.

3.  In **Test Explorer**, select the coded UI test you want to run, open its shortcut menu, and then choose **Run Select Tests**.

     The automated tests run and indicate if they passed or failed.

    > [!TIP]
    > To view **Test Explorer**, choose **Test** > **Windows**, and then choose **Test Explorer**.

4.  Choose the **Output** link in the **Test Explorer** results.

     ![Output link in the Test Explorer](../test/media/cuit_htmlactionlog1.png)

     This displays the output for the test, which includes a link to the action log.

5.  Choose the *UITestActionLog.html* link.

     The log is displayed in your web browser.
