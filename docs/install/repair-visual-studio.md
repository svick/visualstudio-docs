# Repair Visual Studio 2017

Sometimes your Visual Studio installation becomes damaged or corrupted. A repair can fix this.

1. Find the Visual Studio Installer on your computer.

     For example, on a computer running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later, select **Start**, and then scroll to the letter **V**, where it's listed as **Visual Studio Installer**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > On some computers, the Visual Studio Installer might be listed under the letter **"M"** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.<br/><br/> Alternatively, you can find the Visual Studio Installer in the following location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe`

2. Click or tap to start the installer, select **More**, and then select **Repair**.

   > [!TIP]
   > The **Repair** option appears only for installed instances of Visual Studio. If you do not see the **Repair** option, chances are that you've selected **More** in a version that's listed in the Visual Studio Installer as "Available" rather than "Installed".
