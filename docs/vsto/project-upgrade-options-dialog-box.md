# Project Upgrade, Options dialog box
  Use the **Project Upgrade** page to specify whether Visual Studio automatically changes VSTO Add-in projects to target the version of Office that is installed on the development computer.  
  
 To access this page, on the **Tools** menu, click **Options**. Expand the **Office Tools** folder, and then click **Project Upgrade**.  
  
## UIElement list  
 **Always upgrade to installed version of Office**  
 This option is disabled for [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../vsto/includes/vs-dev12-md.md)] because Office projects in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../vsto/includes/vs-dev12-md.md)] can target only [!INCLUDE[office14_long](../vsto/includes/office14-long-md.md)] or Microsoft [!INCLUDE[Office_15_short](../vsto/includes/office-15-short-md.md)] applications. For more information, see [Upgrade and migrate Office solutions](../vsto/upgrading-and-migrating-office-solutions.md).
