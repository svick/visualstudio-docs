# How to: Host An editor in another editor

In Visual Studio, you can host one editor inside another by specifying the hosting window as a parent window. To do so, set the parameters <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.__VSFPROPID2.VSFPROPID_ParentHwnd> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.__VSFPROPID2.VSFPROPID_ParentFrame> on the child window frame.

## To set up the window frame to host an editor

1.  Designate an editor as a hosted editor by creating a child window pane.

     This pane is where the editor's text will go.

2.  Create the hosting editor using the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsUIShellOpenDocument.OpenStandardEditor%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsUIShellOpenDocument.OpenSpecificEditor%2A> method.

3.  Set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.__VSFPROPID2.VSFPROPID_ParentHwnd> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.__VSFPROPID2.VSFPROPID_ParentFrame> properties in the window frame implementation of the hosted editor by passing these properties as the parameters to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsWindowFrame.SetProperty%2A> method, respectively.

     If you need to retrieve these parameters, pass these properties to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsWindowFrame.GetProperty%2A> method.

4.  Call the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsWindowFrame.Show%2A> method for the contained editor.

     The editor appears in the hosted pane of the containing editor.

## Robust programming

The **Application Designer** in the Visual Studio Team Edition for Architects is an example of an editor window frame hosting another editor. The **Application Designer** hosts other designers in its right-hand pane. A designer panel (or **Properties** page) for each of the contained designers is added to the containing window frame.
