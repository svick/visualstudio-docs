## Legacy interfaces in the editor  
 This section explains how to access the editor with legacy (IVs*) interfaces rather than the newer MEF code: [Legacy interfaces in the editor](../extensibility/legacy-interfaces-in-the-editor.md).

 This section explains how to set up tool windows directly in the registry: [Tool windows in the registry](../extensibility/tool-windows-in-the-registry.md).
