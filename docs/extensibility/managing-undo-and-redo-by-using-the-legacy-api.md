# Manage undo and redo by using the legacy API
Editors must support undo operations that let users reverse their recent changes when they modify code. Most editors implemented under [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../code-quality/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] can have undo support automatically provided by the integrated development environment (IDE).  
  
## In this section  
 [How to: Implement undo management](../extensibility/how-to-implement-undo-management.md)  
 Provides undo capability for editors with single or multiple views.  
  
 [How to: Clear the undo stack](../extensibility/how-to-clear-the-undo-stack.md)  
 Describes how to clear an undo stack.  
  
 [How to: Use linked undo management](../extensibility/how-to-use-linked-undo-management.md)
