# NATIVE_ADDRESS
This structure represents a native address.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef struct _tagNATIVE_ADDRESS {  
   DWORD unknown;  
} NATIVE_ADDRESS;  
```  
  
```csharp  
public struct NATIVE_ADDRESS {  
   public uint unknown;  
}  
```  
  
## Terms  
 unknown  
 The native address (the meaning of this depends on the runtime and operating system).  
  
## Remarks  
 This structure is part of the union in the [DEBUG_ADDRESS_UNION](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/debug-address-union.md) structure when the `dwKind` field of the `DEBUG_ADDRESS_UNION` structure is set to `ADDRESS_KIND_NATIVE` (a value from the [ADDRESS_KIND](../../../extensibility/debugger/reference/address-kind.md) enumeration).  
  
## Requirements  
 Header: sh.h  
  
 Namespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop  
  
 Assembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Interop.dll
