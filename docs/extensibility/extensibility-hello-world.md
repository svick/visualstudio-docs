# Create your first extension: Hello World

This Hello World example walks you through creating your first extension for Visual Studio. This tutorial shows you how to add a new command to Visual Studio.

In the process, you will learn how to:

* **[Create an extensibility project](#create-an-extensibility-project)**
* **[Add a custom command](#add-a-custom-command)**
* **[Modify the source code](#modify-the-source-code)**
* **[Run it](#run-it)**

For this example, you'll use Visual C# to add a custom menu button named "Say Hello World!" that looks like this:

![Hello World command](media/hello-world-say-hello-world.png)

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Visual Studio on Windows. For Visual Studio for Mac, see [Extensibility walkthrough in Visual Studio for Mac](/visualstudio/mac/extending-visual-studio-mac-walkthrough).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed the **Visual Studio extension development** workload which includes the VSIX template you'll need and sample code.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any edition of Visual Studio (Community, Professional, or Enterprise) to create a Visual Studio extensibility project.

## Create an extensibility project

Step 1. From the **File** menu, click **New Project**. At the bottom of the screen, enter the name of your project.

Step 2. From the **Templates** menu, click **Visual C#**, click **Extensibility**, and then click **VSIX Project**.

You should now see the Getting Started page and some sample resources.

If you need to leave this tutorial and come back to it, you can find your new HelloWorld project on the **Start Page** in the **Recent** section.

## Add a custom command

Step 1. If you select the manifest, you can see what options are changeable, for instance, metadata, description, and version.

Step 2. Right-click the project (not the solution). On the context menu, click **Add**, and then click **New Item**.

Step 3. Select the **Extensibility** section, and then click **Custom Command**.

Step 4. In the **Name** field at the bottom, give it a name, for instance *Command.cs*.

![custom command](media/hello-world-custom-command.png)

Your new command is listed in **Solution Explorer** under the **Resources** branch. This is also where you'll find other files related to your command, such as the PNG and ICO files if you wish to modify the image.

## Modify the source code

At this point, the Button you're adding is pretty generic. You'll have to modify the VSCT file and CS file if you want to make changes.

* The VSCT file is where you can rename your commands, as well as define where they go in the Visual Studio command system. As you explore the VSCT file, you will notice a lot of commented code that explains what each section of code controls.

* The CS file is where you can define actions, such as the click handler.

Step 1. In **Solution Explorer**, find the VSCT file for your new command. In this case, it will be called *CommandPackage.vsct*.

![command package vsct](media/hello-world-command-package-vsct.png)

Step 2. Change the `ButtonText` parameter to `Say Hello World!`.

```xml
  ...
  <Button guid="guidCommandPackageCmdSet" id="CommandId" priority="0x0100" type="Button">
     <Parent guid="guidCommandPackageCmdSet" id="MyMenuGroup" />
     <Icon guid="guidImages" id="bmpPic1" />
     <Strings>
        <ButtonText>Say Hello World!</ButtonText>
     </Strings>
  </Button>
  ...
```

Step 3. Go back to **Solution Explorer** and find the *Command.cs* file. Change the string `message` for the command `string.Format(..)` to `Hello World!`.

```csharp
  ...
  private void MenuItemCallback(object sender, EventArgs e)
  {
    string message = "Hello World!";
    string title = "Command1";

    // Show a message box to prove we were here
    VsShellUtilities.ShowMessageBox(
        this.ServiceProvider,
        message,
        title,
        OLEMSGICON.OLEMSGICON_INFO,
        OLEMSGBUTTON.OLEMSGBUTTON_OK,
        OLEMSGDEFBUTTON.OLEMSGDEFBUTTON_FIRST);
  }
  ...
```

Make sure to save your changes to each file.

## Run it

You can now run the source code in the Visual Studio Experimental Instance.

Step 1. Click **Start** in the Toolbar. This builds your project and starts the debugger, launching a new instance of Visual Studio called the **Experimental Instance**.

You will see the words **Experimental Instance** in the Visual Studio title bar.

![experimental instance title bar](media/hello-world-exp-instance.png)

Step 2. On the **Tools** menu of the **Experimental Instance**, click **Say Hello World!**.

![final result](media/hello-world-final-result.png)

You should see the output from your new custom command, in this case the dialog in the center of the screen that gives you the **Hello World!** message.
