# Debugging apps in a local Docker container
## Overview
Visual Studio 2017 provides a consistent way to develop in a Docker container and validate your application locally.
You don't have to restart the container each time you make a code change.
This article illustrates how to use the "Edit and Refresh" feature to start an ASP.NET Core Web app in a local Docker container,
make any necessary changes, and then refresh the browser to see those changes.
This article also shows you how to set breakpoints for debugging.

## Prerequisites
The following tools must be installed.

* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with the Web Development workload installed.

To run Docker containers locally, you'll need a local docker client.
You can use the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox), which requires Hyper-V to be disabled,
or you can use [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/get-docker), which uses Hyper-V, and requires Windows 10.

If using Docker Toolbox, you'll need to [configure the Docker client](vs-azure-tools-docker-setup.md)

## 1. Create a web app
[!INCLUDE [create-aspnet5-app](../azure/includes/create-aspnet5-app.md)]

## 2. Edit your code and refresh
To quickly iterate changes, you can start your application within a container, and continue to make changes, viewing them as you would with IIS Express.

1. Set the Solution Configuration to `Debug` and press **&lt;CTRL + F5>** to build your docker image and run it locally.

    Once the container image has been built and is running in a Docker container, Visual Studio launches the Web app in your default browser.
    If you are using the Microsoft Edge browser or otherwise have errors, see [Troubleshooting](vs-azure-tools-docker-troubleshooting-docker-errors.md) section.
2. Go to the About page, which is where we're going to make our changes.
3. Return to Visual Studio and open `Views\Home\About.cshtml`.
4. Add the following HTML content to the end of the file and save the changes.

    ```
    <h1>Hello from a Docker Container!</h1>
    ```
5. Viewing the output window, when the .NET build is completed and you see these lines, switch back to your browser and refresh the About page.

   ```
   Now listening on: http://*:80
   Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down
   ```

6. Your changes have been applied!

## 3. Debug with breakpoints
Often, changes will need further inspection, leveraging the debugging features of Visual Studio.

1. Return to Visual Studio and open `About.cshtml.cs`
2. Replace the contents of the OnGet() method with the following:

   ```cs
       Message = "Your application description page from within a Container";
   ```

3. Set a breakpoint to the left of the code line.
4. Hit **&lt;F5>** to start debugging.
5. Navigate to the About page to hit your breakpoint.
6. Switch to Visual Studio to view the breakpoint, and inspect the value of message.

## Summary
With Docker support in Visual Studio 2017, you can get the productivity of working locally,
with the production realism of developing within a Docker container.
