# Quickstart: Visual Studio Tools for Docker

With Visual Studio 2017, you can easily build, debug, and run containerized ASP.NET Core apps and publish them to Azure Container Registry (ACR), Docker Hub, Azure App Service, or your own container registry. In this article, we'll publish to ACR.

## Prerequisites

* [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the **Web Development**, **Azure Tools** workload, and/or **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload installed

## Installation and setup

For Docker installation, first review the information at [Docker Desktop for Windows: What to know before you install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install). Next, install [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).

## Add a project to a Docker container

1. From the Visual Studio menu, select **File > New > Project**.
1. Under the **Templates** section of the **New Project** dialog box, select **Visual C# > Web**.
1. Select **ASP.NET Core Web Application**.
1. Give your new application a name (or take the default) and select **OK**.
1. Select **Web Application**.
1. Check the **Enable Docker Support** checkbox.

1. Select the type of container you want (Windows or Linux) and click **OK**.

## Dockerfile overview

A *Dockerfile*, the recipe for creating a final Docker image, is created in the project. Refer to [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for an understanding of the commands within it.:

```
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 59518
EXPOSE 44364

FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY HelloDockerTools/HelloDockerTools.csproj HelloDockerTools/
RUN dotnet restore HelloDockerTools/HelloDockerTools.csproj
COPY . .
WORKDIR /src/HelloDockerTools
RUN dotnet build HelloDockerTools.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish HelloDockerTools.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "HelloDockerTools.dll"]
```

The preceding *Dockerfile* is based on the [microsoft/aspnetcore](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore/) image, and includes instructions for modifying the base image by building your project and adding it to the container. 

When the new project dialog's **Configure for HTTPS** check box is checked, the *Dockerfile* exposes two ports. One port is used for HTTP traffic; the other port is used for HTTPS. If the check box isn't checked, a single port (80) is exposed for HTTP traffic.

## Debug

Select **Docker** from the debug drop-down in the toolbar, and start debugging the app. You might see a message with a prompt about trusting a certificate; choose to trust the certificate to continue.

The **Output** window shows what actions are taking place.

Open the **Package Manager Console** (PMC) from the menu **Tools**> NuGet Package Manager, **Package Manager Console**.

The resulting Docker image of the app is tagged as *dev*. The image is based on the *2.1-aspnetcore-runtime* tag of the *microsoft/dotnet* base image. Run the `docker images` command in the **Package Manager Console** (PMC) window. The images on the machine are displayed:

```console
REPOSITORY        TAG                     IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
hellodockertools  dev                     d72ce0f1dfe7  30 seconds ago  255MB
microsoft/dotnet  2.1-aspnetcore-runtime  fcc3887985bb  6 days ago      255MB
```

> [!NOTE]
> The **dev** image does not contain the app binaries and other content, as **Debug** configurations use volume mounting to provide the iterative edit and debug experience. To create a production image containing all contents, use the **Release** configuration.

Run the `docker ps` command in PMC. Notice the app is running using the container:

```console
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                   CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                   NAMES
baf9a678c88d        hellodockertools:dev   "C:\\remote_debugge..."   21 seconds ago      Up 19 seconds       0.0.0.0:37630->80/tcp   dockercompose4642749010770307127_hellodockertools_1
```

## Publish Docker images

Once the develop and debug cycle of the app is completed, you can create a production image of the app.

1. Change the configuration drop-down to **Release** and build the app. 
1. Right-click your project in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Publish**.
1. On the publish target dialog, select the **Container Registry** tab.
1. Choose **Create New Azure Container Registry** and click **Publish**.
1. Fill in your desired values in the **Create a new Azure Container Registry**.

    | Setting      | Suggested value  | Description                                |
    | ------------ |  ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
    | **DNS Prefix** | Globally unique name | Name that uniquely identifies your container registry. |
    | **Subscription** | Choose your subscription | The Azure subscription to use. |
    | **[Resource Group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview)** | myResourceGroup |  Name of the resource group in which to create your container registry. Choose **New** to create a new resource group.|
    | **[SKU](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus)** | Standard | Service tier of the container registry  |
    | **Registry Location** | A location close to you | Choose a Location in a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) near you or near other services that will use your container registry. |

1. Click **Create**

You can now pull the container from the registry to any host capable of running Docker images, for example [Azure Container Instances](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-tutorial-deploy-app).
