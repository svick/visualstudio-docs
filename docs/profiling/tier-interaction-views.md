# Tier Interaction Views

Tier interaction profiling provides additional information about the execution times of functions in multi-tiered applications that communicate with databases through [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../data-tools/includes/vstecado_md.md)]. Data is collected only for synchronous function calls. You can include tier interaction data in all profiling methods.

Tier interaction views are available only in Visual Studio Enterprise.
