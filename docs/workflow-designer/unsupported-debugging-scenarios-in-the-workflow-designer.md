# Unsupported debugging scenarios in the Workflow Designer

The Workflow Designer in .NET Framework 4 added many new features, but there are still some debugging scenarios that it does not support.

The following are the unsupported Workflow Designer debugging scenarios:

-   Execution cannot be continued after code has been edited.

-   Execution cannot be continued from an arbitrary point in the workflow (Set Next).

-   Execution cannot be continued until the cursor is reached (Run to Cursor).

-   The workflow designer cannot be used to debug workflows created in code without the use of the designer.

-   Workflows created in earlier versions of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) cannot be debugged in the .NET Framework 4 designer.

-   Breakpoints cannot be defined on links between activities or <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> nodes.

-   The clipboard is not available during debugging.

-   Breakpoints are not retained when activities are copied or pasted.

-   Workflow breakpoints cannot be set in the call stack window.

-   When creating breakpoints in the designer, the **Line** and **Character** settings in the **New Breakpoint** dialog are not used.

-   The Breakpoint window or shortcut menu does not support the following columns or options for workflow debugging:

    -   Condition

    -   Hit Count

    -   When Hit

    -   Function

    -   Data

    -   Process

    -   Go to Disassembly
