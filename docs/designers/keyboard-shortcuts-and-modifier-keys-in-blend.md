# Keyboard shortcuts and modifier keys in Blend

Keyboard shortcuts can speed up your work by reducing an action that would require multiple mouse-button clicks to a single keyboard shortcut. Keyboard shortcuts in [!INCLUDE[blend_first](../debugger/includes/blend_first_md.md)] come in the following two categories:

- **Access keys** You can use access keys to access a menu command or an area in a dialog box by pressing a specific key on the keyboard. Access keys are identified by underscores that appear in the currently selected command or dialog box.

   To use access keys, first press **Alt** or **F10** to make the underscores appear, and then press the corresponding letter of the specific menu or dialog box item. Alternatively, you can navigate through a menu or dialog box by using the **Tab** key or the arrow keys. For example, if you press **Alt** in [!INCLUDE[blend_subs](../debugger/includes/blend_subs_md.md)], an underline appears under the letter **F** in the **File** menu to identify it as an access key. To open a project, you could press and hold **Alt**, press **F**, and then press **O**.

- **Shortcut keys** You can use shortcut keys to perform an action (such as selecting a menu command or modifying the behavior of a tool) by pressing a keyboard shortcut.

   Most keyboard shortcuts are easy to identify in the user interface of [!INCLUDE[blend_subs](../debugger/includes/blend_subs_md.md)]; they are displayed to the right of menu commands. For example, on the **File** menu, the **Open Project** menu command includes the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**O**. To see the shortcut keys for a tool in the **Tools** panel, hover the pointer over the tool.

## Modifier keys

Some keyboard shortcuts do not have associated menu items, which means that you can't use the [!INCLUDE[blend_subs](../debugger/includes/blend_subs_md.md)] user interface to discover them. The following topics list shortcuts that modify the behavior of tools, or that modify an action, such as resizing an object:

-   [Artboard modifier keys](../designers/artboard-modifier-keys-in-blend.md)

-   [Pen tool modifier keys](../designers/pen-tool-modifier-keys-in-blend.md)

-   [Direct Selection tool modifier keys](../designers/direct-selection-tool-modifier-keys-in-blend.md)
