# Animate objects in XAML Designer

You can create short animations that move objects, or fade them in and out.

To get started, create a *storyboard*. A storyboard contains one or more *timelines*. Set *keyframes* on a timeline to mark property changes. Then, when you run the animation, Blend interpolates the property changes over the designated period of time. The result is a smooth transition. You can animate any property that belongs to an object, even nonvisual properties.

The following illustration shows a storyboard named **MoveUp**. The timeline contains keyframes that mark the X and Y position of a rectangle. When this animation runs, the rectangle moves from one position to another smoothly.
