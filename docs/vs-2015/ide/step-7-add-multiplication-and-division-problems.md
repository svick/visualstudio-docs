# Step 7: Add Multiplication and Division Problems
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In the seventh part of this tutorial, you'll add multiplication and division problems, but first think about how to make that change. Consider the initial step, which involves storing values.  
  
### To add multiplication and division problems  
  
1.  Add four more integer variables to the form.  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#15](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/cs/form1.cs#15)]
     [!code-vb[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#15](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/vb/form1.vb#15)]  
  
2.  As you did before, modify the `StartTheQuiz()` method to fill in random numbers for the multiplication and division problems.  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#16](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/cs/form1.cs#16)]
     [!code-vb[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#16](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/vb/form1.vb#16)]  
  
3.  Modify the `CheckTheAnswer()` method so that it also checks the multiplication and division problems.  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#17](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/cs/form1.cs#17)]
     [!code-vb[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#17](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/vb/form1.vb#17)]  
  
     You can't easily enter the multiplication sign (ร) and the division sign (รท) using the keyboard, so Visual C# and Visual Basic accept an asterisk (*) for multiplication and a slash mark (/) for division.  
  
4.  Change the last part of the timer's Tick event handler so that it fills in the correct answer when time runs out.  
  
     [!code-csharp[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#23](../snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/cs/form1.cs#23)]
     [!code-vb[VbExpressTutorial3Step7#23](../snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/vbexpresstutorial3step7/vb/form1.vb#23)]  
  
5.  Save and run your program.  
  
     Quiz takers must answer four problems to complete the quiz, as the following illustration shows.
