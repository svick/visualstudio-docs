# How to: Fire Events When the Editor Loses Focus
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Sometimes it is necessary to know when an editor loses focus on the window frame. For example, you might need to extract code from a code window after the editor is no longer focused on it. The following procedure provides the steps to follow to receive notification of the editor losing focus.  
  
### To fire an event in response to an editor losing focus  
  
1.  Monitor selection events by obtaining an <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsMonitorSelection> object from <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.SVsShellMonitorSelection>.  
  
2.  Call <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsMonitorSelection.AdviseSelectionEvents%2A> and provide it your <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSelectionEvents> object.  
  
3.  In your call to <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsSelectionEvents.OnElementValueChanged%2A>, look for `elementid==SEID_WindowFrame`.  
  
4.  Test the `varValueNew` parameter for two things:  
  
    1.  The window frame you are looking for.  
  
    2.  The point at which your program loses the selection to that window frame.
