# Extending Properties and the Property Window
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The **Properties** window is used to view and edit the design-time properties and events of selected objects.  
  
 When you select an object in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], the public properties of that object appear in the **Properties** window. For more information, see [Properties Window Overview](../extensibility/internals/properties-window-overview.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Exposing Properties to the Properties Window](../extensibility/exposing-properties-to-the-properties-window.md)  
 Explains how you can have your custom properties displayed in the Properties window.  
  
 [Getting Project Properties](../extensibility/getting-project-properties.md)  
 Explains how to get project properties.
