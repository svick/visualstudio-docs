# Project Types
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] includes several project types for languages such as [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] also lets you create your own project types.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Essentials](../../extensibility/internals/project-type-essentials.md)  
 Presents the important information that you must have to start working with project types.  
  
 [Creating Project Types](../../extensibility/internals/creating-project-types.md)  
 Discusses the design of project types.  
  
 [Adding a Command to the Solution Explorer Toolbar](../../extensibility/adding-a-command-to-the-solution-explorer-toolbar.md)  
 Details the steps that you must follow to add a button to the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] **Solution Explorer** toolbar.  
  
 [Adding Web Services to Project Systems](../../misc/adding-web-services-to-project-systems.md)  
 Shows how to integrate Web services into your VSPackage project system.  
  
 [Renaming Project Hierarchy Nodes (C++)](../../misc/renaming-project-hierarchy-nodes-cpp.md)  
 Shows how to rename a project folder hierarchy node.  
  
 [Adding Project and Project Item Templates](../../extensibility/internals/adding-project-and-project-item-templates.md)  
 Discusses how you can add templates to your project types so that users can create new projects and project items according to a pattern.  
  
 [Opening and Saving Project Items](../../extensibility/internals/opening-and-saving-project-items.md)  
 Provides information about how to manage the items your project type supports.  
  
 [Managing Configuration Options](../../extensibility/internals/managing-configuration-options.md)  
 Discusses how your project types can support configuration options like Debug and Release that control how projects are built, debugged, and so forth.  
  
 [Supporting Source Control](../../extensibility/internals/supporting-source-control.md)  
 Provides information about how to add support for source-control systems to your project types.  
  
 [Nesting Projects](../../extensibility/internals/nesting-projects.md)  
 Explains how your project types can support *nesting*, so that projects can be grouped together in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 [Upgrading Projects](../../extensibility/internals/upgrading-projects.md)  
 Describes how your project type can participate in the Upgrade Wizard to upgrade project files from an earlier version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 [Architecture](../../extensibility/internals/project-types-architecture.md)  
 Provides detailed technical information about project types.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Hierarchies and Selection](../../extensibility/internals/hierarchies-and-selection.md)  
 Provides an overview of how the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) displays a project as a hierarchy.  
  
 [Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes.md)  
 Provides links to project subtype topics. Project subtypes enable extension of most kinds of project types, including your own.  
  
 [Projects](../../extensibility/internals/projects.md)  
 Describes how to extend the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] project system.
