# Project Types Architecture
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This section contains detailed information about the architecture of project types in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Elements of a Project Model](../../extensibility/internals/elements-of-a-project-model.md)  
 Lists the services a project type can consume and the interfaces it must implement.  
  
 [Project Model Core Components](../../extensibility/internals/project-model-core-components.md)  
 Describes the interfaces project types both must implement and optionally can implement to provide additional functionality.  
  
 [When to Create Project Types](../../extensibility/internals/when-to-create-project-types.md)  
 Helps you decide when you must create a project type and when you can use another [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] extensibility feature such as VSPackages and editors to achieve the same goal.  
  
 [Hierarchies and Selection](../../extensibility/internals/hierarchies-and-selection.md)  
 Describes how [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] uses hierarchies and selection context to provide a consistent and simplified user experience.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Project Subtypes](../../extensibility/internals/project-subtypes.md)  
 Explains how project subtypes let you customize the behavior of the project systems of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)].  
  
 [Project Types](../../extensibility/internals/project-types.md)  
 Provides an overview of projects as the basic building blocks of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). Links are provided to additional topics that explain how projects control building and compiling code.
