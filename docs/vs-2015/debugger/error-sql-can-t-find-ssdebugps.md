# Error: SQL Can&#39;t Find SSDEBUGPS
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

SSDEBUGPS.dll is the SQL Server Debugging Host component.  
  
 This error occurs when you are trying to start debugging, and indicates that the specified file is not present on the [!INCLUDE[sqprsqlong](../includes/sqprsqlong-md.md)] machine. Possible causes are that either Remote Debugging setup was never run, or that somehow this file got deleted.  
  
 There are two ways to resolve this error: by rerunning Remote Debugging setup, and by copying the file onto the [!INCLUDE[sqprsqlong](../includes/sqprsqlong-md.md)] machine.  
  
 To rerun Remote Debugging setup, follow the instructions at [Remote Debugging](../debugger/remote-debugging.md).  
  
 If you can locate a copy of ssdebugps.dll, you can copy it onto the [!INCLUDE[sqprsqlong](../includes/sqprsqlong-md.md)] machine. If present, the file will be in the directory \Program Files\ Common Files\Microsoft Shared\SQL Debugging. You might find it on another [!INCLUDE[sqprsqlong](../includes/sqprsqlong-md.md)] machine, or on a machine that has [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../includes/vsprvslong-md.md)] installed.  
  
### To copy SSDEBUGPS.dll onto the SQL Server 2005 machine  
  
1.  Copy the file to the directory with the same name and path on the [!INCLUDE[sqprsqlong](../includes/sqprsqlong-md.md)] machine.  
  
2.  Register it by opening a **Command Prompt**, and running the following command:  
  
    ```  
    regsvr32 ssdebugps.dll  
    ```
