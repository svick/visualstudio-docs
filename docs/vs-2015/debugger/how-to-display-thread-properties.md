# How to: Display Thread Properties
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

To find out more about a thread listed in [Threads View](../debugger/threads-view.md), use the [Thread Properties Dialog Box](../debugger/thread-properties-dialog-box.md).  
  
### To open a Thread Properties dialog box  
  
1. Select a thread from the tree displayed in [Threads View](../debugger/threads-view.md).  
  
2. From the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.  
  
   Properties dialog boxes are not modal, so you can click on another item in a view window and the dialog box will show information on the selected item.
