# How to: Enable and Disable Automatic Code Analysis for Managed Code
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can configure Code Analysis to run before each build of a managed code project. You can set different Code Analysis properties for each [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] configuration.  
  
### To enable or disable automatic code analysis  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the properties dialog box for the project, click **Code Analysis**.  
  
3.  Specify the build type in **Configuration** and the target platform in **Platform**.  
  
4.  To enable or disable automatic code analysis, select or clear the **Enable Code Analysis on Build (defines CODE_ANALYSIS constant)** check box.
