# Tier Interaction Views
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Tier interaction profiling provides additional information about the execution times of functions in multi-tiered applications that communicate with databases through [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../includes/vstecado-md.md)]. Data is collected only for synchronous function calls. You can include tier interaction data in all profiling methods.
