# Specifying the Path to Profiling Tools Command Line Tools
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The path of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Profiling Tools command-line tools is not added to the PATH environment variable. On 32-bit computers, the tools are in a single directory. There are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the profiling tools on 64-bit computers.  
  
## 32-bit computers  
 On 32-bit computers, the default profiler tools directory is *Drive*\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Team Tools\Performance Tools.  
  
## 64-bit computers  
 On 64-bit computers, specify the path according to the target platform of the profiled application.  
  
-   For 32-bit applications, the default profiler tools directory is:  
  
     *Drive*\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Team Tools\Performance Tools
