# Messaging Activity Designers
Messaging activity designers are used to create and configure messaging activities that send and receive [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../includes/indigo1-md.md)] messages from within a [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] application. The [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] introduces five messaging activities and the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] provides two new template designers that enable you to manage messaging within a workflow. The topics contained in this section and listed in the following table provide guidance on how to use the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../includes/wfd2-md.md)] activity and template designers.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Message Activity|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|[CorrelationScope](../workflow-designer/correlationscope-activity-designer.md)|Creates and configures a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity that provides implicit management of child messaging activities with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> object.|  
|[InitializeCorrelation](../workflow-designer/initializecorrelation-activity-designer.md)|Creates and configures an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.InitializeCorrelation> activity that is used to initialize correlation without sending or receiving a message.|  
|[Receive](../workflow-designer/receive-activity-designer.md)|Creates and configures a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity that receives a message from a service.|  
|[ReceiveAndSendReply](../workflow-designer/receiveandsendreply-template-designer.md)|Creates a pre-configured pair of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> activities within a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity.|  
|[Send](../workflow-designer/send-activity-designer.md)|Creates and configures a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> activity that sends a message to a service.|  
|[SendAndReceiveReply](../workflow-designer/sendandreceivereply-template-designer.md)|Creates a pre-configured pair of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activities within a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity.|  
|[TransactedReceiveScope](../workflow-designer/transactedreceivescope-activity-designer.md)|Creates and configures a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity which enables the flow of transactions into a workflow.|
