# Developing Workflow Applications Targeting the .NET 3.0 or .NET 3.5 Framework
[!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] provides the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../includes/wfd1-md.md)] for creating [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] applications that target the [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)]. The designer uses the familiar [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] user interface for the graphical construction and debugging of workflow applications.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../includes/vs2010-md.md)] also provides access to a legacy workflow designer that can be used to target the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)]. This section contains guidance on using this legacy designer.
