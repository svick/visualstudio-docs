# Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Build apps that run on iOS, Android, and Windows devices and share nearly 100% of your code. Build them with your favorite web technologies. Apache Cordova gives you native access to device capabilities like the camera on a phone, and best of all, itâ€™s free. Visual Studio adds these extras to make it even easier to build your app:  
  
- Easy installation and setup.  
  
- Advanced debugger to help you find and fix problems.  
  
- Easy access to device emulators.  
  
- A designer to manage your device plug-ins.  
  
- A project that is completely compatible with the command line interface.  
  
If you're considering these tools, but you're not ready to try them yet, visit our [features](https://www.visualstudio.com/explore/cordova-vs) page, and we'll tell you more about them.  
  
If you're ready to start, see [Mobile development with JavaScript](/visualstudio/cross-platform/tools-for-cordova/?view=toolsforcordova-2017).
