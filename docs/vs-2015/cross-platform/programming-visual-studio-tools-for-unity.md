# Programming Visual Studio Tools for Unity
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

  
In this section, you'll find examples for using the Visual Studio Tools for Unity API.  
  
## Examples  
 Here are some examples that show how you can use the Visual Studio Tools for Unity APIs.  
  
### Customize project files created by VSTU  
 Visual Studio Tools for Unity provides a Unity-style callback during project file generation. To learn how you can modify the project file whenever it's regenerated, see [Example: Project File Generation](../cross-platform/customize-project-files-created-by-vstu.md).  
  
### Share the Unity log callback with VSTU  
 Visual Studio Tools for Unity registers a log callback with Unity to be able to stream its console to Visual Studio. If your editor scripts also register a log callback with Unity, the VSTU callback might interfere with it. To learn how you can share the Unity log callback with VSTU, see [Example: Log Callback](../cross-platform/share-the-unity-log-callback-with-vstu.md).
