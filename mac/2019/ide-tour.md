# Visual Studio 2019 for Mac Preview tour

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio 2019 for Mac is [now available](installation.md) as a preview for testing.

Visual Studio for Mac evolves Xamarin's mobile-centric IDE, Xamarin Studio, into a mobile-first, cloud-first development environment on the Mac. This developer-focused tool allows you to use the power of .NET to create applications for all platforms required by your users.

The user experience (UX) of Visual Studio for Mac is similar to that of its Windows counterpart, but with a native macOS feel. Creating, opening, and developing an app will be a familiar experience for anyone who has previously used Visual Studio on Windows. In addition, Visual Studio for Mac employs many of the powerful tools that make its Windows counterpart such a powerful IDE. The Roslyn Compiler Platform is used for refactoring and IntelliSense. Its project system and build engine use MSBuild, and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.

This article explores various sections of Visual Studio for Mac, providing a look at some of the features that make it a powerful tool for creating cross-platform applications.

## IDE tour

Visual Studio for Mac is organized into several sections for managing application files and settings, creating application code, and debugging.

## New start window

When you start Visual Studio 2019 for Mac Preview, new users will see a sign-in window. Sign-in with your Microsoft account to activate a paid license (if you have one) or link to Azure subscriptions. You can press **Skip** and sign in later via the **Visual Studio > Sign in** menu item:

![Sign in to your Microsoft account](media/ide-tour-2019-start-signin.png)

Signed-in users will see the new _start window_, which shows a list of recent projects, and buttons to open an existing project or create a new one:

## Solutions and projects

The following image shows Visual Studio for Mac with an application loaded:

The following sections provide an overview of the major areas in Visual Studio for Mac.

## Solution pad

The Solution Pad organizes the project(s) in a solution:

This is where files for the source code, resources, user interface, and dependencies are organized into platform-specific Projects.

For more information on using Projects and Solutions in Visual Studio for Mac, see the [Projects and Solutions](/visualstudio/mac/projects-and-solutions) article.

## Assembly references

Assembly references for each project are available under the References folder:

Additional references are added using the **Edit References** dialog, which is displayed by double-clicking on the References folder, or by selecting **Edit References** on its context menu actions:

For more information on using References in Visual Studio for Mac, see the [Managing References in a Project](/visualstudio/mac/managing-references-in-a-project) article.

## Dependencies / packages

All external dependencies used in your app are stored in the Dependencies or Packages folder, depending on whether you are in a .Net Core or Xamarin.iOS/Xamarin.Android project. These are usually provided in the form of a NuGet.

NuGet is the most popular package manager for .NET development. With Visual Studio's NuGet support, you can easily search for and add packages to your project to application.

To add a dependency to your application, right-click on the Dependencies / Packages folder, and select **Add Packages**:

Information on using a NuGet package in an application can be found in the [Including a NuGet project in your project](/visualstudio/mac/nuget-walkthrough) article.

## Refactoring

Visual Studio for Mac provides two useful ways to refactor your code: Context Actions, and Source Analysis. You can read more about them in the [Refactoring](/visualstudio/mac/refactoring) article.

## Debugging

Visual Studio for Mac has a native debugger allowing debugging support for Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac, and Xamarin.Android applications. Visual Studio for Mac uses the Mono Soft Debugger, which is implemented into the Mono runtime, allowing the IDE to debug managed code across all platforms. For additional information on debugging, visit the [Debugging](/visualstudio/mac/debugging) article.

The debugger contains rich visualizers for special types such as strings, colors, URLs, as well as sizes, co-ordinates, and b√©zier curves.

For more information on the debugger's data visualizations, visit the [Data Visualizations](/visualstudio/mac/data-visualizations) article.

## Version control

Visual Studio for Mac integrates with Git and Subversion source control systems. Projects under source control are denoted with the branch listed next to the Solution name:

Files with uncommitted changes have an annotation on their icons in the Solution Pane, as illustrated in the following image:
