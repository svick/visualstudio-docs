# Setting up an Azure Dev/Test Pay-As-You-Go subscription
Collaborate with your team in the cloud.  Create multiple Dev and Test Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions, enabling collaboration with other subscribers while also providing isolation between teams and environments.  You receive exclusive discounted hourly rates for dev/test and cloud use rights for your subscription software on Azure.

1. To use your Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription benefit, sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and click on the **Activate** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.

2. If you have already activated an Azure account as part of your subscription benefits (for example, if you have an Enterprise subscription and activated your $150 monthly Azure credit), skip to step 5.

3. On the Microsoft Azure Sign up page, you’ll have the option to either set up the Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test offer (PAYG), or upgrade to the Visual Studio Enterprise offer.  Click **Continue with the current offer (Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test)** if you don’t wish to upgrade.

6. In the Agreement section, click on the check box to accept the subscription agreement, offer details and privacy statement, then click **Purchase**. 

7. On the **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** page you’ll have the option to buy a support plan, or get started using your subscription.   

8. If you choose to get started using your subscription, you’ll see the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and, if it’s your first visit, you’ll be offered a quick tour of some of the features.  Once you’ve completed or opted out of the tour, you’ll see the Dashboard.  You’re ready to start using Azure!
