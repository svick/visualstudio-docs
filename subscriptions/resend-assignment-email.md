# How to resend subscription assignment emails in the Visual Studio subscription management portal


The process for resending assignment emails from within the manage.visualstudio.com portal is very simple:

1. Visit the [manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com) portal and sign in. 
2. Use the **Filter** tab to search for the subscriber to whom you want to resend the assignment email. (For more information about filtering, please see [Search for a subscription](search-license.md).)
3. Click on the subscriber(s).  You can use Ctrl+click or Shift+click to select multiple subscribers.
4. Click **Resend** at the top of the search results.  


> [!NOTE]
> - Newly assigned subscriptions will generate the assignment email automatically. The above is only necessary when a user requests a new assignment email notification or the notification is not sent for any reason.
