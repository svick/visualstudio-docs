# Azure DevOps benefits for Visual Studio subscribers

As an active Visual Studio subscriber, you can use a range of features in Azure DevOps that are included with your subscription as a benefit. You'll be able to use these same features in each Azure DevOps organization in which you are a member, whether you created the organization or were added by someone else.

When you sign in to Azure DevOps using either the identity that you used for activating your Visual Studio subscription or your [alternate identity](vs-alternate-identity.md), we recognize this automatically.
