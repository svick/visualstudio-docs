#  WhiteSource Bolt in Visual Studio subscriptions

Find and fix open source vulnerabilities and generate comprehensive inventory and license reports of all open source components in your build. Some Visual Studio subscriptions include six months of free access.

## Activation steps

1. To activate your WhiteSource Bolt benefit, sign in to [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) .

2. Locate the WhiteSource Bolt tile in the Tools section, and click on the **Get Code** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![WhiteSource Benefit Tile](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-tile.png)

3. You’ll receive a notification displaying your activation code.  **Copy the code to your clipboard**, then click **Activate**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![WhiteSource Benefit Code ](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-code.png)

4. On the WhiteSource web page, click on the **Activate** button or scroll down to the **Activate your account** section of the page.

   > ![WhiteSource Benefit Activate](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-activate-page-cropped.png)

5. In the **Activate your account** section of the page, you’ll be guided through four steps:

   - [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whitesource.ws-bolt) the WhiteSource Bolt extension from Microsoft Visual Studio marketplace. If you don’t have permissions to install extensions, see [Install free extensions for Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/marketplace/install-vsts-extension?view=vsts).


Click the green **Install** button if you are using Azure DevOps Services, or the **Download** button for Team Foundation Server.  For this example, we will use Azure DevOps Services.

> ![WhiteSource Benefit Install Extension](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-download-install.png)

- Next, select the Azure DevOps organization you want to use and click **Confirm**.  (If you have not yet set up Azure DevOps Services, visit the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) page and activate your Azure DevOps Services benefit.)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![WhiteSource Benefit Confirm Account](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-confirm-account.png)

- You’ll receive a confirmation that the extension is installed and ready to use.  Click **Get started** to return to the WhiteSource Bolt page and continue.
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![WhiteSource Benefit Install Complete](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-install-complete.png)

5. Open your Azure DevOps project dashboard, click on the **Azure Pipelines** menu and choose **WhiteSource Bolt**.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![WhiteSource Benefit Add Extension](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-installed-cropped.png)

6. Paste the activation code from the WhiteSource Bolt benefit tile and click **Activate**. Each of your activation codes can be used to activate only one project.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![WhiteSource Benefit Activate Code](_img/vs-whitesource/vs-whitesource-activate-code-cropped.png)

7. Your activation is now complete, and you will have 180 days remaining on your subscription.

8. You’ll need to add the WhiteSource Bolt extension as one of your build steps.  A video is available on the [WhiteSource Bolt page](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/whitesource_bolt_visualstudio_2017/#activate) to show you how.

9. Once you’ve run your build, the following comprehensive reports and dashboards will be generated automatically:
    - Security vulnerabilities dashboard
    - Security vulnerabilities report
    - Outdated libraries report
    - License risks and compliance dashboard
    - Inventory report
