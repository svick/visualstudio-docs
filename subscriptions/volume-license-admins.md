# Accessing the portal and managing administrators - for subscriptions acquired through Volume Licensing (VL)

**Volume License Service Center (VLSC)**

As of March 1st, 2017, customers who are still working through the portal onboarding and migration process will need to manage their subscriptions in the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC).

For more information about managing subscriptions in the VLSC please see these guides:
[Understanding Visual Studio Subscriptions for VLSC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Understanding-Visual-Studio-Subscriptions-Administration-Guide-for-VLSC.pdf)

**Visual Studio subscriptions administration portal**
If your organization has been migrated, but you haven’t been set up in the new portal yet, your Primary or Notices Contact for your organization’s Volume Licensing contract will need to take a few steps to onboard your organization and set you up as an administrator.

If you have already been set up as an administrator, then you can go directly to the Visual Studio subscriptions [Administrator Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com/).

**Onboarding your organization**

When your organization is ready to be onboarded to the Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal an email will be sent to the Primary and Notices Contacts inviting them to complete the onboarding process. The below details are the steps that need to be taken in order to onboard to the new portal. If you’d like to walk through the process, check out this administrator onboarding video  or the next sections in docs.

1.	Locating your PCN and signing in

     a.	In the email, the Primary and Notices Contacts are provided with a unique link and the last three digits of their Public Customer Number (PCN).  (If the Primary or Notices Contacts receive more than one email, this means that they have more than one PCN. They will need to complete the process using the unique link for the PCN referenced in each email.)

     b.	To obtain the entire PCN, the Primary Contact will need to sign in to the VLSC. [Instructions for locating the PCN](find-pcn.md)

     c.	After obtaining the PCN, they’ll need to select their unique link which will prompt them to sign in. They will be able to sign in using either a work/school account (if your organization is on AAD) or a Microsoft Account (MSA) if your organization is not on AAD.

     d.	Next, they will need to enter the PCN.

2.	Set up your administrators.  After entering the PCN, they will be registered as a super admin in the new system and will be able to add other super admins and administrators (previously known as Subscription Managers). To avoid losing access this should be completed prior to your organization’s migration date.

3.	Accessing the new subscription management portal. Once your organization is migrated, emails will be sent to the newly added super admins and administrators inviting them to access the new portal and begin managing subscriptions.

If you need to be added to the new Visual Studio Subscriptions Administration Portal and you aren’t sure who your Primary/Notices Contact is, you can find this information after signing in to the [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx). Take a look at the [Find Your Primary Contact](find-primary-contact.md) topic for steps to locate your Primary/Notices Contact in the VLSC.

If you have already been set up as an administrator, then you can go directly to the Visual Studio subscriptions Administration Portal at: [https://manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
