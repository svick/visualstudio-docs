# Xamarin University training benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

Build native iOS and Android apps in C# with advanced training by mobile development experts.

Xamarin University will be moving content over to [Microsoft Learn](http://microsoft.com/learn), a new interactive training platform and the future of learning at Microsoft. Therefore, Xamarin University benefits for Visual Studio Enterprise and Professional subscribers will no longer be valid starting December 21, 2018 – the last date to claim your benefit. 

If you’ve activated your 3 or 6-month benefit, please note that the Xamarin University site will shut down in June 2019. Office Hour sessions and instructor-led only courses will remain available until May 1, 2019, allowing you to finish any in-progress Xamarin certifications. After May 1, these programs, including the Xamarin certification exams, will no longer be available. Once the program shuts down, you’ll be able to go to Microsoft Learn to continue building your Xamarin development skills. 

If you aren’t able to activate your benefit in time, know that Xamarin University will be moving most certification and Xamarin.Forms courses over to their [Self-Guided Learning](https://elearning.xamarin.com) portal by early 2019, making them completely free. To access these courses, simply [create a free Xamarin University account](https://university.xamarin.com/createfreeaccount). In the following months, all self-guided learning courses will convert to Microsoft Learn, which will lead to the shutdown of Xamarin University at the end of June 2019. The rest of the subscriber-only content, including labs and off-topic videos such as Guest Lectures and Lightning Lectures, will be made publicly available elsewhere. 

See the [Xamarin University FAQ](https://university.xamarin.com/faq) for details.

Until December 21, 2018, Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers receive six months of unlimited access to the full Xamarin University catalog.  Visual Studio Professional subscribers receive three months of access.
