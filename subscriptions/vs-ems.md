# Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) in Visual Studio Subscriptions

Visual Studio Enterprise annual cloud and standard subscriptions include Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS).  Secure and manage your identities, devices, apps and data with EMS - Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, Azure Information Protection, Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics, and Microsoft Cloud App Security.
